Project Documentation – LADS(License Authorization and Driver's Safety)

-----------------------------------------------------Introduction ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LADS is a software based project for road safety and awareness. It helps minimise few of major factors of road accidents such as unauthorized/underage drivers and Driver dizziness.
A camera is mounted inside the car, which acts a face recognition tool. As the driver starts the car, camera is used to recognize the driver's face from a local database.
In case of failure to recognize the face from the local databse, the driver is provided with following options.
1. Register their License
2. Retry Facial Recognition
3. QR Code Authentication : If Facial Recognition fails multiple times, user can opt for a QR Code to be sent to the registered email, which can be scanned to let the user drive.
4. Unauthorized Driving : In case of emergency, user can opt to skip the authentication procedure. The admin is sent a message and the camera captures images of the driver.

Once the authentication is done, Drowziness Detector is activated. It works by starting a countdown timer of 5 seconds once the eyes are closed beyond the threshold limit.
The timer resets if eyes open up, else it sounds a loud beeping alarm to alert the driver. (Optional: Change to auto-pilot mode in smart cars)

Admin usage file:
Contains encryption and decryption codes for admin only
Driverfaces:
Contains stored images 
Haar:
Contains all required haar cascoded files for the program
Adminaccess.b64:
Encrypted file for admin to access the data from the cloud.
Admindata:
Python file which provides data of car no. and date for admin in encrypted form
Adminlicence and Adminsleepy:
Python files which will be raised during unauthorized driving and sleepiness detection         and send data to database in encypted form for admin
Alarm,Alarm2,Alarm3:
Three different alarm sound files provided for sample which will be raised during sleepiness detection
Decrypteddf:
python file which helps decrypting the Licensefinal.b64
Final:
Python code which should be run the admin at the start and which helps to raise all  other python files
QR_request:
Python file which create random  and unique QR code each time when we run it
Sleepyness_detection:
Python file which contains code for sleepiness detection
StoringImages:
Python file which stores image of the person who is detected
Test,TrainingImages:
Python files which contains codes test to test and train images the which are stored

Usage Guide:
Use anaconda for better experience:
1.	git clone https://github.com/kodatiRevanth/LADS-License-Authorization-and-Drivers-Saftey
2.	cd LADS-License-Authorization-and-Drivers-Saftey
3.	create a virtual environment (Recommended)
	o	conda create -n environment_name python=3.7
4.	activate virtual environment
	o	conda activate environment_name
Install requirements.txt:
•	pip install cmake
•	pip install -r requirements.txt
Changes needed to be done before usage:
•	(Environment Python-3.7)
•	All the paths needed to be changed according to your requirements.
•	Install all the required packages.

Single time usage programs
1. To store the driver's/ user's image locally use StoringImages.py (Each click will correspond  to each stored photo).
2. Train the image using TrainingImages.py (It trains all the photos that are stored in the database).\
   You can also skip the above step and directly run the appication and make the storing and training from the below application itself
3. Run Final.py program for usage of LADS application.
